# My-demo-projects
This is my first demo project with
Django.
I managed to upload the project but unfortunately I had to create a new repository with the same content. I am providing a link to my new repo for this purpose (https://github.com/Aleksey-Kostov/agro_marketplace) and I am also providing a link to the uploaded project (https://agromarketplace-dabdgufzg3gxe8ea.italynorth-01.azurewebsites.net/). The website is a place where buyers and sellers of agricultural products can connect with each other. There is also a messaging system for sending and receiving messages. Each profile has the ability to control the ads, which can be activated and removed. My profile can also be edited. I hope you like my project.
